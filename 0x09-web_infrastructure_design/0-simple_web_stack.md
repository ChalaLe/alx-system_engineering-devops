Explanation:

A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com. They enter
the URL in their web browser.

DNS (Domain Name System) resolution takes place to resolve the domain name
www.foobar.com to its associated IP address. The DNS records for the domain
foobar.com have a "www" record that points to the server's IP address, 
which is 8.8.8.8 in this case.

The user's request reaches the router, which acts as the entry point to
the network.

The router forwards the request to the server with the public IP address 8.8.8.8.

The server consists of multiple components:

Web Server (Nginx): It receives the incoming HTTP requests from the user's browser.
It serves static content and can also act as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic
requests to the application server.

Application Server: It runs your code base, handles dynamic content generation,
and interacts with the web server. It processes the user's request and generates
the appropriate response.

Database (MySQL): It stores and manages the website's data. The application
server interacts with the database to retrieve or store data as needed.
The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol.
The web server receives the HTTP request, passes it to the application server,
which processes the request and generates an HTTP response. The response is
then sent back through the same chain to reach the user's browser.

Issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since there is only one server, if it goes down
or experiences any issues, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during maintenance: When maintenance tasks like deploying new code or
updating the web server are required, the website may experience downtime.
Limited scalability: With only one server, it may not handle high incoming
traffic efficiently. If the traffic increases significantly, the server may
become overwhelmed and affect the website's performance.

To address these issues, a more scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure
would involve load balancing, multiple servers, redundancy, and other measures
to ensure high availability and performance.
