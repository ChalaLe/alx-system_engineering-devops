Explanation:

UExplanation:

1. User's Computer: Represents the user's device from which they access the website.

2. DNS Resolution: The domain name www.foobar.com is resolved to the IP address of
the load balancer.

3. Domain Name: Represents the domain name www.foobar.com associated with the website.

4. Router/Firewall: Acts as a gateway and provides network security by controlling
traffic between the internet and the internal network.

5. Load-Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers
to ensure scalability, high availability, and improved performance. It uses
a distribution algorithm (such as round-robin, least connections, or IP hashing)
to determine how to distribute requests among the web servers.

6. Web Servers (Nginx): Receive incoming HTTP requests from the load balancer.
They serve static content and can act as reverse proxies to forward dynamic
requests to the application server.

7. Application Server: Runs your code base and handles dynamic content generation.
It processes the user's request, interacts with the database, and generates
the appropriate response.

8. Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data. It supports
a primary-replica (master-slave) cluster setup for high availability and data redundancy.

Additional elements and their purposes:

Load-Balancer: Added to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers,
enabling scalability and fault tolerance.
Second Server/Web Server/Application Server: Added for redundancy and to handle
increased traffic load.
Firewall: Although not explicitly shown, it is essential for network security by
controlling traffic and protecting against unauthorized access.
Distribution algorithm of the Load-Balancer:
The load balancer (HAproxy) is configured with a distribution algorithm, such as
round-robin, that evenly distributes requests among the available web servers.
This ensures that each web server receives its fair share of incoming traffic.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive setup:
The infrastructure can be considered an Active-Passive setup, where the load balancer
directs traffic to one server at a time while the other server remains idle.
In the event of a failure, the load balancer switches traffic to the standby server.
Active-Active setup would involve both servers actively serving traffic simultaneously.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:
The database is set up as a primary-replica cluster, where the primary node handles write
operations (data modification) and replicates the data to the replica nodes.
Replica nodes serve as read replicas, allowing for scalable read operations and
providing data redundancy. If the primary node fails, one of the replica nodes can
be promoted to become the new primary node.

Difference between Primary and Replica nodes:

Primary Node: Handles write operations, ensures data consistency, and replicates
data to replica nodes.
Replica Node: Provides read access to data, improves read scalability, and serves
as a backup in case the primary node fails.

Issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The load balancer, database, and individual servers
can become single points of failure if they experience issues, causing service disruptions.
Security Issues: The infrastructure lacks a dedicated firewall to protect against
unauthorized access. Additionally, there is no mention of HTTPS for secure communication.
Monitoring: There is no mention of monitoring tools or mechanisms to track the health
and performance of the infrastructure components, making it challenging to identify
and resolve issues promptly.

Addressing these issues would involve implementing redundancy, incorporating security
measures like firewalls and HTTPS, and setting up monitoring systems to ensure
the availability, security, and performance of the infrastructure.ser's Computer:
