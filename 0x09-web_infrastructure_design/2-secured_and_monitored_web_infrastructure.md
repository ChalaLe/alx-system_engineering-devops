Explanation:

UExplanation:

1. User's Computer: Represents the user's device from which they access the website.

2. DNS Resolution: The domain name www.foobar.com is resolved to the IP address of
the load balancer.

3. Domain Name: Represents the domain name www.foobar.com associated with the website.

4. Router/Firewall: Acts as a gateway and provides network security by controlling
traffic between the internet and the internal network.

5. Load-Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers
to ensure scalability, high availability, and improved performance. It uses
a distribution algorithm (such as round-robin, least connections, or IP hashing)
to determine how to distribute requests among the web servers.

6. Web Servers (Nginx): Receive incoming HTTP requests from the load balancer.
They serve static content and can act as reverse proxies to forward dynamic
requests to the application server.

7. Application Server: Runs your code base and handles dynamic content generation.
It processes the user's request, interacts with the database, and generates
the appropriate response.

8. Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data. It supports
a primary-replica (master-slave) cluster setup for high availability and data redundancy.

Additional elements and their purposes:

Firewalls: Added to enhance network security by controlling traffic flow and
protecting against unauthorized access.

SSL Certificate: Implemented to serve the website over HTTPS, ensuring
encrypted communication between the user's browser and the server, enhancing security.

Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors): Deployed to collect and monitor various
metrics and logs related to the infrastructure's performance, availability,
and security. This data is typically sent to monitoring services like Sumo Logic.

Importance of firewalls: Firewalls are essential for network security.
They control inbound and outbound traffic, enforce access control policies,
and protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

Traffic served over HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts the communication between the user's
browser and the server, ensuring data privacy and integrity. It prevents
eavesdropping, data tampering, and unauthorized access to sensitive information
transmitted over the network.

Role of monitoring: Monitoring is used to track the health, performance, and
security of the infrastructure. It helps detect and diagnose issues, proactively
identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal operation.

Data collection by monitoring tools: Monitoring tools collect data by
deploying monitoring clients or agents on the infrastructure components.
These clients collect metrics, logs, and other relevant information and
send it to the monitoring service for analysis and visualization.

Monitoring web server QPS: To monitor the web server's queries per second (QPS),
you can set up monitoring to track metrics such as the number of requests
received per second, response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
This data provides insights into the server's performance and helps identify
any performance issues or capacity constraints.

Issues with this infrastructure:

1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer level: While terminating SSL at the
load balancer improves performance, it means that the traffic between the
load balancer and the web servers is not encrypted. This poses a potential
security risk if the internal network is compromised.

2. Single MySQL server accepting writes: Having only one MySQL server
capable of accepting write operations introduces a single point of failure (SPOF).
If this server goes down, it can result in downtime and data loss.
Implementing a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for MySQL
would provide redundancy and high availability.

Identical components on servers: Having servers with the same components
(database, web server, and application server) might be a problem if
a vulnerability or issue affects one component. It could lead to a
widespread impact across all servers. It's important to implement proper
security practices and keep software components up to date to mitigate such risks.

Remember, this is a simplified whiteboard design, and actual implementation
considerations may vary based on specific requirements and infrastructure complexities.
